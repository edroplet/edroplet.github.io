# The production_url is only used when full-domain names are needed
# such as sitemap.txt
# Most places will/should use BASE_PATH to make the urls
#
# If you have set a CNAME (pages.github.com) set your custom domain here.
# Else if you are pushing to username.github.io, replace with your username.
# Finally if you are pushing to a GitHub project page, include the project name at the end.
#
#production_url : https://edroplet.github.io

# All Jekyll-Bootstrap specific configurations are namespaced into this hash
#
JB :
  version : 0.3.0

  # All links will be namespaced by BASE_PATH if defined.
  # Links in your website should always be prefixed with {{BASE_PATH}}
  # however this value will be dynamically changed depending on your deployment situation.
  #
  # CNAME (http://yourcustomdomain.com)
  #   DO NOT SET BASE_PATH
  #   (urls will be prefixed with "/" and work relatively)
  #
  # GitHub Pages (http://username.github.io)
  #   DO NOT SET BASE_PATH
  #   (urls will be prefixed with "/" and work relatively)
  #
  # GitHub Project Pages (http://username.github.io/project-name)
  #
  #   A GitHub Project site exists in the `gh-pages` branch of one of your repositories.
  #  REQUIRED! Set BASE_PATH to: http://username.github.io/project-name
  #
  # CAUTION:
  #   - When in Localhost, your site will run from root "/" regardless of BASE_PATH
  #   - Only the following values are falsy: ["", null, false]
  #   - When setting BASE_PATH it must be a valid url.
  #     This means always setting the protocol (http|https) or prefixing with "/"
  # BASE_PATH : http://edroplet.github.io/

  # By default, the asset_path is automatically defined relative to BASE_PATH plus the enabled theme.
  # ex: [BASE_PATH]/assets/themes/[THEME-NAME]
  #
  # Override this by defining an absolute path to assets here.
  # ex:
  #   http://s3.amazonaws.com/yoursite/themes/watermelon
  #   /assets
  #
  
  # ASSET_PATH : false
  # ASSET_PATH : https://edroplet.github.io/assets/

  # These paths are to the main pages Jekyll-Bootstrap ships with.
  # Some JB helpers refer to these paths; change them here if needed.

  archive_path: /archive.html
  categories_path : /categories.html
  tags_path : /tags.html
  atom_path : /atom.xml

  #
  #   pages_list :
  #     provider : "custom"
  #
  # Setting any helper's provider to 'custom' will bypass the helper code
  # and include your custom code. Your custom file must be defined at:
  #   ./_includes/custom/[HELPER]
  # where [HELPER] is the name of the helper you are overriding.
